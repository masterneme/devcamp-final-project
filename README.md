# DevCamp Final Project
 
I tried to use everything taught on the course but there're things that I didn't because it didn't look necessary like the skewed div.  

I didn't know if the challenge was to just mimic what was shown in the picture so I added more stuff, even media queries.  

I have taken time to inspect several elements on the real CodePen website to copy colors, fonts and other design elements.  

I found their main fonts but the one in the first paragraph of the left block that looks thin, is just one that I took from Google Fonts that combined well and had the thickness I wanted.  

And I want to clarify that if you open the page with Firefox there's a chance that an error may show up in the console. It's not my fault, [it's a Font Awesome bug](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/19925).  

I say this because one of the requirements is to not have errors on the console.  

I chose to use semantic elements to wrap blocks instead of divs.  

And I added CSS variables to the main page to make the process more efficient, so I didn't have to switch between documents to use colors and fonts.
